## Zoos and animal welfare {.h2}

### Zoological park

> An establishment which maintains a collection of wild animals, typically in a park or gardens, for study, conservation, or display to the public.

### Animal welfare

> Opportunity to express species-typical behaviours to cope with environmental or internal stressors (Broom, 1980).

::: notes
Zoos are man made creations.Hence zoos provide a rare glimpse into the ever-changing relationship between nature and man. The objectives of a modern zoo goes beyond public recreation into the fields of conservation breeding and ex-situ conservation.
-  captivity forces animals to relinquish  control over their environment.
-  Which  leads to chronic stress resulting in a loss of behaviour diversity,  lowered fertility, and other factors leading to a unstable captive population unfit of repatriation to the wilderness.
- Animal welfare as a concept attempts to provide animals the opportunity to cope with internal and external stressor & thereby regain control which leads to better psychosomatic outcomes.

Introduction
:::

::: notes
-  Animal welfare is a well established concept in the modern era.
-  Although I know the benefits of keeping animals in a good state of welfare. 
-  The factors contributing to good welfare are not fully understood since they vary contextually. 
-  Therefore if we keep animals in good health and appropriate social grouping followed by some other confounding factors that we will dicuss today, we can ensure good welfare conditions. 
-   Animals in good welfare  retain species typical behaviour diversity and therefore have higher chance of survival after reintroduction.
- Animals in good welfare lead to reliable ex-situ research outcomes.
- Finally animals in good welfare lead to a more conservation-focused polity that aids in securing long term future for endangered species.

Introduction
:::

::: notes
-   By the end of the nineteenth century the debate on animal sentience was resolved by Darwin and several other experts. His  book on the expression and emotion by man and animals showed that animals can truly feel pain.
- in 1892 the first handbook on captive animal management in zoos was published by the Mr RB Sanyal curator of Alipore zoological garden, India.
-   For over a century there have been several champions of animal welfare like Dr., Heini hediger the father of zoo biology  and ruth Harrison who brought in the animal  rights movement.

-   India has also witnessed a proliferation in zoos and conservation breeding centers.
-   There are more than 149 zoos and 25 conservation breeding programmes operational in the country. There are more than 50000 captive animals in Indian zoos.
-   Unfortunately, research output on the welfare status of animals from these institutions is abysmal.
-   Although there has been some welfare research on zoo-housed animals. Little to no literature exisits on the welfare of endangered animals housed at Indian conservation breeding centers.
-  To address this research gap, I looked into the welfare status of Asiatic lions housed at one of the oldest conservation breeding programmes for the species in India at Sakkarbaug zoo Junagadh, Gujarat.

::: notes
-    Sakkarbaug zoological garden, falls within the natural range of Asiatic lions.

-   Established in 1863 as a menagerie by the Nawabs of Junagadh( a princely state in British India), This zoo has a long history with Asiatic lion conservation.

-   Since its foundation, this zoo has been associated with the rehabilitation and breeding of Asiatic lions and presently houses 60 Asiatic lions, that includes a large number of wild-rescued animals.

-   SZG is of immense importance to Asiatic lion conservation and therefore it is imperative to audit and improve their incumbent management practices for the species regularly.

::: notes
There are presently 674 Asiatic lions in the wild, and 300 lions form the global captive population.

-   While in-situ research on Asiatic lions has led to several affirmative conservation actions, there have been few studies reported from the ex-situ management program for the species in their range country.

-   No studies on the welfare of lions in a conservation breeding programme.
-   Small sample sizes.

Introduction
:::

::: notes
-  Studies on captive asiatic lions have primarily focused on their breeding cycles.
-  some studies from London zoo have addressed their welfare status in a limited manner.
-  In fact there is limited literature available on the welfare status of lions. 
-  There is a prominent research gap in the welfare status assessment of captive Asiatic lions housed in the conservation breeding programme.
- Which I aim to address to some extent today.

Introduction
:::

::: notes
I aimed to understand the predominant factors affecting welfare status of captive Asiatic lions.
- To achieve that goal I looked into the external factors like enclosure complexity and visitor presence.
- I also explored the effect of inter-individual differences on differential welfare outcomes under similar housing conditions.
- Finally I wanted to understand if welfare conditions could be improved using enrichment interventions.
Now I will discuss each of my chapters in detail

:::

::: notes
My goals for this objective was to understand how enclosure complexity and visitor presence relate with  asiatic lion welfare.
-   There is no debate about the fact that enclosure type, size and complexity are largely responsible for the welfare of captive animals.
-   This has been proven across studies spanning several decades now.
-   However very fes studies have looked into the effects of visitor presence and enclosure complexity together.
-   Moreover, none of the exisiting studies have had strong sample sizes, which is a common hindrance to most zoo-based studies.

- There are three types of enclosures at Sakkarbaug zoo on-display, zoo-safari and off-dsiplay
-  The on-display enclosures are small and exposed to a large visitor volume throughout the day except Wednesday when the zoo is closed.
-  The zoo-safari  enclosures are situated at the foothills of girnar at the distal portion of the main zoo premise.
-  A safari bus is allowed to move periodically through this area, wherein viistors can look at asiatic lions in large naturalistic enclosures without disembarking from the bus.
- The thrid type of enclosures are found in the same area that constitute the conservation breeding programme for Asiatic lions. Visitors and outsiders are not allowed in this complex.

- I used enclosure comlexity scoring to understand the species-appropriateness of enclosures.
- I used several behavioural welfare indices to understand the welfare status of asiatic lions.
- Before commencing the data collection I conducted an ad-libitum study to create a  detailed ethogram for Asiatic lions.
- I also corrected for observer bias before  commencing behaviour data collection.

-   To collect the behavioral data, I divided the enclosures into ten equal zones
-   I used instantaneous scans at 1-minute intervals for one hour followed by a 15-minute rest to reduce observer fatigue.\*
-   observations were made in six-hour blocks between 7-11 and 1300-1900 hours
-   In total, I collected 127 hours of scan observation data per subject
-   During each scan I recorded the behavioral state of the animal and the enclosure zone it was using.\*
-   I counted the scans in which animals were performing species-typical behaviors and aberrant repetitive behaviors and also measured the total amount of time they spent on different enclosure zones.
- I calculated the species-typical behaviour diversity using the shanon weiner index  formula.
- I calculate the homogeneity of enclosure usage with SPI formula developed by Amy Plowman. A score close to 1 denote enclosure zone bias, while a score less than 0.5 means homogenous enclosure use.
- Calculations were done separately for 70 visitor and 14 non-visitor days.

::: notes
-  On display enclosures scored poorly on all aspects of enclosure design  compared to off-display and zoo-safari enclosures. The only exception being feeding practices, which was similar for all three enclosures.
-  On-display enclosures lacked vegetation features, space and wwere deemed unsafe for keepers, animals and visitors.
-  Therefore in terms of complexity there were two types of enclosures and  in terms of visitor presence we had three enclosure types.
:::

## Results: Activity budget

::: goal
-   Lions housed in on-display enclosures showed more ARB and rested less during visitor presence days.
-   On no-visitor days on-display animals  performed slightly less stereotypy.
-  There was slight increase in arb level of lions on non-visitor days at the zoo-safari.

## Summary

::: goal
-   Lions housed at off-display and zoo-safari areas had significantly higher levels of behaviour diversity compared to on-display animals.
-   On-display enclosures are poorly-equipped to meet the welfare requirement of Asiatic lions.

-   Some of the lions housed at high-complexity off-display enclosures had behaviour diversity levels similar to the on-display animals.


-   I found no discernible effect of visitor presence on behaviour diversity, enclosure usage or ARB levels.

-   If an enclosure is large and complex it can offset the effects of visitor presence.

-   Lack of enclosure complexity can exacerbate the effects of visitor presence.

-  The wide variation in welfare outcomes in off-display enclosure lions require further investigation.
:::
::: notes

-   These findings highlight several glaring issues pertaining to the welfare of captive felids at Indian zoos. Particularly, the gross welfare inequity within the same zoological institution.

 -  The lack of enrichment protocol and species-appropriate furnishing at most enclosures is a significant issue that is frequently overlooked in zoos.
-  Lions housed at the off-display and zoo-safari areas had significantly higher levels of behaviour diversity  and enclosure usage.
 
-  The lions at the off-display enclosures overall showed better welfare outcomes than those at the on-display areas. However the wide variation in the welfare outcomes of lions housed at  the off-display enclosure suggests  that there are other factors which might be affecting the welfare of these animals other than the external ones.
 
-  Therefore we must look at the internal factors or the inter-individual variations in the subject pool to understand the reasons for differential welfare outcomes under similar housing conditions.

::: notes
-  To answer the  welfare variation in the lions at the off-display enclosures I looked at internal factors affecting welfare.
-  I asked if personality, sex, grouping type and rearing history were associated with changes in welfare outcomes.
- I also wanted to understand how the behavioural and physiological welfare indices were associated with each other.
-  We published this study in 2020.

-   Bold and shy continuum indicator of cognitive ability.
-   Keeper rating bold or shy score of 9-1 ( 9 being very bold and 1 very shy) on 15 personality attributes.
-   Latency to a 10 minute exposure to non-food novel object.

Chapter 2
:::

::: notes
 I already knew about the rearing history of the subjects.
-  To categorize subjects based on boldness or shyness, I took a two-pronged approach
-  first, I asked keepers with more than three years of experience to rate subjects on a scale of 1-9 on 15 personality attributes.
-  Then I introduced each subject separately to non-food novel objects and recorded their reaction
-   Independent observers recorded the latency times to react to novel objects and the type of behavior ( playful, fearful, curious) performed by the animal.
-   I created our own list of bold and shy animals and compared the same with keepers.
-   I only included individuals whose personality traits were agreed upon by keepers and observers.

## Methods: Corticosterone metabolite extraction {style="text-align:center;"}

![Workflow for hormone metabolite extraction](figures/workflow.png)

::: footer
Chapter 2
:::
:::notes

-  I collected two faecal samples per subject and  Preserved the entire sample in a freezer before they were lyophilized and pulverized for the next step.
-  after thoroughly mixing the dried fecal powder we extracted hormone we pulse vorted o.1 gm of fecal pwder in 15ml of 70% ethanol followed by centrifugation at 2200rpm for 20 minutes.
- the hormone extracts were stored at -20degrees in cryochill vials.
-  Shiv Patel and I used arbor assay corticosterone kit for the ELISA assays to measure faecal corticosterone metabolites  and  pooled the mean corticosterone FGM means for all animals within our subject groups to calculate test statistics.
:::

## Methods: Corticosterone validation

![](figures/cortaccuracy.png){style="align:center;"}

::: footer
Chapter 2
:::
::: notes
 We tested for prallelism and accuracy to validate the corticosterone assay.
-  For parallelism we pooled extracts from a random combination of samples to find optimal dilutions for final assays. 
-  We plotted relative dose against the standard and a parallel slope indicates similar immunoreactivity to the standard solution.
- For accuracy test we spiked corticosterone standards with different dilutions of the same faecal concentrate solution. and plotted the results using observed and expected concentrations to ensure that faecal contaminants did not interefere with the results. 
-  to ensure reliability, We also calculated intra and inter assay coefficients of variation using repeated measures of same pooled extracts .

## Results: Comparison of welfare measures

- No difference in welfare measures based on sex, and social grouping.
- Welfare measures primarily vary based on personality-trait and rearing-history.

::: notes
-  Latency scores validated the keeper ratings and our classification of subjects on the bold-shy continuum.
-  We also found that Most wild-rescued animals were categorized as shy while most captive animals were categorized as bold.
- We can speculate that this is probably something to do with the fact that the captive-born animals are accustomed to the captive environment and are not neophobic to humn introduced devices inside the enclsoures.
- The two largest groups Bold captive and shy wild animals differed significantly on the latency scores.

-  Behaviour diversity is an important positive indicator for animal welfare that has gained popularity in the past few decades.
-  I used the Shannon Weiner diversity index to calculate it.
-  Results
   -   Here I see a similar trend that was highlighted in the ARb section
   -  Captivebold and wildshy animals were diametrically opposite to one another, and the captiveshy and wildbold animals lay somewhere in between.
   
   -  It was interesting to note that the captive origin animals had higher behaviour diversity than the wild origin animals.
   
   -  This loss in behaviour diversity in wild animals could be speculatively attributed to the fact that most of them were rescued as adults.
   -  Hence in captivity, these wild-rescued lions do not have access to the complex range of stimuli linked with diverse behavioral repertoires.
   -  Although the enclosures at SZG are large, naturalistic, and provide for the captive-born animals, they are unable to meet the requirement of the wild-rescued individuals.

-   I calculated the spread of the participation index that measures the homogeneity of enclosure usage.
-  Results

  -   SPI value of 1 means that animals have a significant preference for one or two zones and do not use the rest of the areas.

  -   I found that the SPI values for wild shy animals were uncomfortably high, which meant that they spent most of their time at a single part of the enclosure without exploring the other zones. 

  -   Therefore I see that wild-rescued shy animals are performing more stereotypy, showing fewer species-typical behaviours and performing more aberrant behaviors as compared to captive born animals.

## Summary

::: goal

-   Personality and rearing-history strongly associated with welfare indices.

-   Wild-rescued animals with shy personalities need more care.

-   Individual-tailored husbandry regimes required.

-    Multi-dimensional welfare assessment necessary to optimise captive animal management.

-   Sex and social grouping does not affect welfare measures.

-   Behavioural welfare indices are reliable indicators for physiological stress.

-   Behaviour diversity levels were explained by enclosure usage pattern and ARB levels.

-   Further investigations required to understand the strong correlation between FGM levels and latency values.

:::

::: footer
 Chapter 2
:::

::: notes
-  Personality and rearing history account for some of the inter-individual differences in welfare outcomes.
- These findings challenge the current notion that wild animals are likely to have higher behaviour diversity. 
-   findings suggest that context matters. wild animals rescued and brought into captivity loose the stimulus to perform a significant amount of their typical behavior repertoire. while captive born animals in our study have retained most of their repertoire.
-  Therefore enclosure design and management practices for wild-rescued animals have to be designed to meet their unique requirement.
-  Contrary to some existing research I found that sex and social grouping did not affect welfare variations under similar husbandry conditions.
-  While I found that behavioural welfare indices were in line with physiological measures. I discovered that  behaviour diversity of an animal was primarily explained by the enclosure usage pattern and the level of ARB expressed by them.
-  Therefore zoo managers must pay special attention to individuals who develop enclosure zone bias and start performing displacement behaviours.
-  I found that latency to novel object was highly correlated to the FGM level of subjects. This needs further investigation.

::: goal
-   Subjects randomly divided into control(N =16, seven enclosures) and test group(N =19, seven enclosures).
-   Baseline period lasted 14 days with weekly scat collection.
-   Enrichment interventions were made for one week period.
-   14 days of post-enrichment data collection commenced.

Chapter 3
:::

::: notes
- I used 35 Asiatic lions housed at 14 enclisures for this study.
- Enclosures were randomly assigned to control and test enclosures.
-  Baseline behaviour observation with weekly scat collection commenced for 14 days for both control and test groups.
- After that I introduced a combined enrichment intervention at the test enclosures, while no changes were made to the control enclosures.
- Following a one week habituation period. I collected post-treatment data on both control and test group subjects to measure the impacts of the enrichment interventions.

## Chapter summary

::: goal
-   Enrichment interventions led to positive impact on the behavioural and physiological welfare indices.
-  A universal welfare evaluation framework.
-  A combined enrichment approach of manipulable, feeding and sensory enrichment is best suited for long term engagement for Asiatic lions.
-  All enrichment devices should be provided in excess at multiple locations.
-  High value food rewards create positive reinforcement to novel objects.
-  Tailored enrichment interventions should be integrated with the management practices of all captive felids.
:::

::: footer
Chapter 3
:::

::: notes
 -  Animal welfare  not only means prevention of cruelty, it also seeks to create opportunities for captive animals to experience positive affective states.
 
 -  Our study is the first  to showcase the impact of enrichment interventions on the behavioural and physiological welfare of Asiatic lions conclusively.
 
 - The welfare measurement framework used in this study is largely species-agnostic and can be applied to any modern zoological institution to assess welfare impacts of goal-oriented enrichment interventions. 
 
 - I found that  enrichment devices specially manipulable and feed based enrichment create a positive relation with novel objects and lead to better welfare outcomes and longer engagement times. however there should be a large number of such objects to prevent infighting and aggressive monopolizations.
 -  The enrichment interventions shown here require little  monetary input but can have large positive welfare impacts. Therefore it is suggested to incorporate them in the management of large captive felids at Indian zoos and conservation breeding programmes.
 
:::



## Summary and recommendations

::: goal
-   Animal welfare is affected by enclosure complexity.
-   Personality and rearing history cause differential welfare outcomes to similar management practices.
-   Bold and shy personality traits are ubiquitous across both rearing-history types.
-   Enclosure enrichment integrated with daily husbandry can lead to positive welfare outcomes.
:::

###  Recommendations

-   Animal welfare should be the driver of captive animal management.
-   Both external and internal factors should be considered while measuring welfare in captive animals.
-   Inter-individual differences can lead to differential welfare outcomes to similar husbandry practices.
-   Enrichment interventions can improve welfare parameters significantly.
-   Lack of scientific inputs and manpower should be addressed.

::: notes

-   Animal welfare is an overlooked aspect of captive animal management across most Indian zoos and conservation breeding centers.
-   My thesis shows that animal welfare is dependent on the enclosure complexity and it species appropriateness followed by internal factors like personality and rearing history.
-  Finally, Enrichment interventions are very effective in creating opportunities for good welfare and should be integrated with incumbent management practices.
-  I have visited several small medium and large zoos in India and one thing stands out. There is a distinct lack of manpower at most of them. 
-  Zoo management need to invest in keeper training and zoo biologists to address the welfare epidemic at Indian zoos.

::: notes
- I created this graph by extracting data from the studbook data of Asiatic lions which shows that since 2010. The captive population of the CBP at SZP has been augmented primarily by wild-rescued lions as opposed to animals born in captivity. This may be linked to several issues such high juvenile mortality and low genetic diversity that has been highlighted other researchers. But it definitely requires us to audit the existing management practices and make policy changes to the management of Asiatic lions. 
-  Conservation breeding programmes have turned into a panacea and Indian zoos presently accommodate such programmes for 25 endangered endemic species.

-  Unfortunately, Indian conservation breeding programmes seldom publish  animal welfare reports and there is little evidence to suggest the existence of an active welfare monitoring programme at most sites.

- Despite the overwhelming evidence for enrichment interventions few zoos have an active enrichment-linked management policy for any endangered species.

-   The Asiatic lion conservation breeding programme has been operational since 1995. with breeding records dating back to 1958. 

- The goal of the conservation breeding plan was to create a captive population as an insurance policy. Now that the goal has been achieved, why not start with the repatriation of some animals to reclaimed habitats?

-   There is an urgent need to recalibrate the management practice for Asiatic lions. So that these animals become fit for successful repatriation.

-  The conservation story of Asiatic lions prominently features 59 research papers and over a dozen doctoral thesis on the wild population.

-  Yet it took over two decades for us to address the welfare status of the captive population housed in the Conservation breeding programme.

-  I hope that our study sparks the conversation about animal welfare at Indian CBP. and inspires researchers, academics and zoo managers to audit incumbent management practices.

- Finally I hope that the managers and ecologists realize the importance of this conservation breeding programme and take it to the reintroduction phase.
